Hi everyone, 
this repository regroup two projects I worked in.The first, called authlog, is about a cgi program, which is made to get authentification of some user on your pc. The second one, named sitemanager, is also a cgi program, which allows you to hosts a site easily.
So, how these two programs work?
For authlog, either you just need to run in a url you made before the file called "front_form.html" , or yo need to run the file called "accueil.html". in the two case, you just have to follow steps written in the site and it should be good.
For sitemanager, either you need to run in a url you made before the file called "main_page.html", or you need to run the file called "accueil.html". In the two cases, you have to follow steps written in the site.
